That’s because this is making me fit and I think if I do it for the while month or maybe even just this whole week I will most definitely lose some pounds and burn some belly fat. I mean it is a little tiering but anywhere they have good exercises then it will tire you and you will be tired afterwards. "

Some of the menus call for our of season fruits though and there are some typos but the main thing is the meals and ingredient lists- !!! The workouts are hard but brief cause I’m at zero, but little by little I’ll be a Better Me"
